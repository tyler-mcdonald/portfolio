        .about-bio
          p I'm a former accounting professional pursuing a career in software development. During my time as an accountant, I found myself constantly looking to leverage technology to automate tasks for myself, my teammates, and the company I worked for. Eventually I understood that my true passion is in technology. I plan to make a career out of building software to improve the lives of those around me and around the world.
